## SWEN90009 2022 - Software Requirements Analysis

## Overview
This is the repository for SWEN90009 project: NDIS (National Disability Insurance Scheme), a web platform where Behaviour Support Providers (BSPs) can upload behaviour support plans for People with Disabilities (PwD), and have them analyzed by a Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm to provide them with feedback for improvement and to direct them to further resources.


## [Documentation](docs/)

The documantation is divided into serverral sections : 
***
* [Criterias & Tests](docs/Criterias%20&%20Tests/) : Documents to be used for testing i.e, Acceptance Criterias, Acceptance Tests & Tracability Matrix  
    * [Acceptance Criteria](docs/Criterias%20&%20Tests//Acceptance%20Criteria.pdf)
    * [Acceptance Test](docs/Criterias%20&%20Tests/Acceptance%20Test.pdf)
    * [Tracability Matrix](docs/Criterias%20&%20Tests//Tracability%20Matrix.pdf)
* [Product Market Research](docs/Product%20Market%20Research/) : Documents realted to Product and User research i.e, Do/Be/Feel List, Goal Model & Personas  
    * [Personas](docs/Product%20Market%20Research/Personas) : Personas of different possible users of the system  
    * [Do Be Feel List](docs/Product%20Market%20Research/Do_Be_List.pdf)
    * [Goal Model](docs/Product%20Market%20Research/Goal_Model.pdf)

##### Task Scenarios
All User Scenarios & Tasks

**NDIS Behaviour Support Provider**
You are an NDIS behaviour support practitioner who has been assigned a new NDIS participant to provide support for: Rodger Stapleton. You need to write a behaviour support plan for Rodger and check its quality.
- Download a blank behaviour support plan template
- Upload a new behaviour support plan for Rodger to the system
- View the feedback from the system
- Share the plan with Rodger's family contact

You send the plan to Rodger's family contact, who reads the plan and submits the family member survey. You need to evaluate the feedback from the system and from the family and revise the plan.
- View the survey feedback from Rodger's family contact
- Re-upload the behaviour support plan

You have completed your work with Rodger. You now want to delete the plan from the system, but first, you want to check an older version of the plan for something.
- Navigate through the system home page to look for Rodger's plan (use both list and thumbnail views, and use the search bar as well)
- Go to a previous version of Rodger's behaviour support plan
- Delete Rodger's behaviour support plan


**Family Contact of NDIS Participant**
You are working with an NDIS practitioner to help provide support for your disabled son, Rodger. The practitioner has finished the first version of a behaviour support plan and has sent you a link to view it, along with some system-generated feedback on the plan.
- View the behaviour support plan PDF
- View the feedback from the system
- Submit the family member survey to give comments and suggestions

#### Client Validation Video
You can find the client's demo/validation video on the following confluence page : [High Fidelity Prototype](https://confluence.cis.unimelb.edu.au:8443/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=101459502).
